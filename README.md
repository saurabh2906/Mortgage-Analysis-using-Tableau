# Mortgage-Analysis-using-Tableau
This case is about a finance company that specialises in giving various types of loans to customers. In this case analysis we will try to throw some light on the factors to know the basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: • If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company • If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify factors which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (too risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
